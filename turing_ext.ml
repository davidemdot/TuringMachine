"... an infinite memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape 
marked out into squares on each of which a symbol could be printed. At any 
moment there is one symbol in the machine; it is called the scanned symbol. 
The machine can alter the scanned symbol and its behavior is in part 
determined by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect 
the behavior of the machine. However, the tape can be moved back and forth 
through the machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the 
machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an innings."
